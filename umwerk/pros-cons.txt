PROS:
  - private data
  - user does not need to pay for transactions
  - better scalability since every chaincode is a separate process
  - does not complain that a javascript class is too long

CONS:
  - same speed as Ethereum BC (slow transactions, fast reading)
  
  - deployment complexity
    - a bunch of servers/docker images (orderer, peers, ca, cli)
    - certificates must be generated (user, server, channel)
    - before servers are started a bunch of bash variables must be set correctly
    
  - chaincode is basically just another nodejs process
  - hyperledger is just a bunch of nodejs processes with a couchdb behind

  - complex javascript api (compared to Ethereum BC)
  - some libraries will probably have to be changed for them to work in browsers

  - no coin

  - before user can invoke transactions certificates need to be generated

  - data is saved as a key-value pairs, complex data needs to be converted to a json string
